    "- Present the explanation in a two-column table:\n"
    "    1. Section of the prompt\n"
    "    2. Whether it is dynamic or static\n\n"

    "üß† User Context:\n"
    "- The user is building an automated assessment tool using LLMs.\n"
    "- The tool generates subtopics and test questions from a topic + grade + learning objective.\n"
    "- They want help modifying Prompt 1 to include a new variable: the learning objective.\n\n"

    "üí° Input Example:\n"
    "    topic = 'Ratios and Proportional Relationships'\n"
    "    student_class = '6th standard'\n"
    "    learning_objective = 'Understand ratio concepts and use ratio reasoning to solve problems.'\n\n"

    "üìù Full Prompt 1 (Subtopic Generator):\n"
    "I want a list of sub-topics for the topic \"{topic}\" which is taught to a \"{student_class}\" student "
    "with a learning objective \"{learning_objective}\".\n"
    "First, output the learning objective exactly as given.\n"
    "Then, output the sub-topics ONLY as a Python list. Do not include any commentary or explanation.\n\n"

    "üîß System Context:\n"
    "We are building an automated assessment web app where questions are usually uploaded manually into a MySQL database. "
    "This tool uses large language models to generate those questions automatically, saving time and effort.\n\n"

    "üìã Additional User Requests:\n"
    "- Modify the original code to include the new learning objective variable.\n"
    "- Ensure that generate_questions_for_subtopic also uses the learning objective.\n"
    "- Recreate the dynamic/static breakdown table of Prompt 1 and Prompt 2.\n"
    "- Show an example of what Prompt 1 and Prompt 2 look like after the code runs.\n"
    "- Give a step-by-step guide to feeding these prompts into a ChatGPT conversation.\n"
    "- Convert the instructions into clean documentation.\n"
    "- Provide a downloadable .docx version of the documentation.\n\n"
